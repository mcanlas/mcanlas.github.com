yet another monad tutorial

* monads are a set of guarantees that some programmers use to help do their jobs more efficiently (this is the definition for "my mom")
* what guarantees?
  * monad laws as assertions (like unit tests) or an interface to be fulfilled
* some programmers => type safe programmers, intro to the value of type safety
* efficiency, like the difference between explicit c-style loops (with index) vs implicit loops (hidden counter)
