This question is from Quora. *What is an implementation detail?*

**Implementation details are where the mechanics of a system begin to betray the model.**

Let's say there's a model where you push a button and you magically get $100. That seems like a pretty simple model. One user action, instantaneous, measurable reward.

Let's talk about what happens when you push that button. The button is connected to a computer which sends an e-mail to Task Rabbit. The e-mail asks someone to hold up a bank (silly example, I know). The robber keeps most of the money, but leaves $100 to the system. The system gives you this $100.

In the contrived example above, we can see that what is actually going doesn't match what most people would think happens when a magic button gives them $100. **This is an implementation detail.**
