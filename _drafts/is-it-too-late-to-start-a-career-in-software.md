do i need a degree in software?

meritocracy, degree not important

wealth of online resources

requires commitment. uphill battle against other mentally plastic/agile applicants

up against people who self select/love software

Less talk, more practice.

Don't waste your time worrying about which choices to make. Just make a choice and keep practicing, with a focus on how can I improve for next time.

You are starting at a huge deficit since you are not already fluent. It will be an uphill battle whose only solution is hard work. It will help if you actually find programming enjoying.
