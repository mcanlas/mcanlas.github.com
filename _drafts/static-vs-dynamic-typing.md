I happen to be in the middle of a career transition from a dynamic language to a static one and this has been on my mind for a while.

I didn't say dynamic languages can't scale. They can. With lots of effort and plumbing and unit tests, you can make anything scale. But they don't scale well. Or out of the box.

I think making a dynamic language scale requires discipline. And programmers are humans and only have a finite amount of discipline. Therefore, when scale goes up, so does the need for discipline.

Static languages do incur a nominal "cost" in the prototyping stages, but I feel that is a drop in the ocean compared to the amount of scale you get per unit of discipline spent.
